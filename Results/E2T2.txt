Listed only Critical and High issues:

- For WebAppSG
    - Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk (port 5000)
    - Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22 and 3389
    - Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports

- For AttackInstanceSG
    - Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk (port 5000)
    - Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22 and 3389
    - Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports

- For instance Web Service Instance - C3
    - EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
    - EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)

- For instance Attack Instance - C3
    - EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
    - EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
